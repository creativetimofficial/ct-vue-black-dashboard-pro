**[Vue Black Dashboard PRO](https://demos.creative-tim.com/vue-black-dashboard-pro)** is a beautiful Bootstrap 4 Admin Dashboard that comes in 2 versions: Dark and Light Mode. If you are looking for a tool to manage and visualize data about your business, this dashboard is the thing for you. It combines colors that are easy on the eye, spacious cards, beautiful typography, and graphics.

We made it our priority to not add things that you don't need, so the Vue Black Dashboard PRO comes with just enough features for you to easily use. It combines multiple components and plugins and features numerous example of how it can be used. Inside the archive, you will also find multiple example pages to get you started or provide inspiration.


**[Vue Black Dashboard PRO](https://demos.creative-tim.com/vue-black-dashboard-pro)** is the extended version of [Black Dashboard PRO](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/product/black-dashboard-pro-premium-bootstrap-4-admin/). Based on feedback from people that downloaded and used it, we have added needed components, and we have created multiple examples pages. We are curious to see how you want to use it and also improve it, so let us know any feedback you have.

**Bootstrap 4 support**


Vue Black Dashboard PRO is built on top of [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) Most of the elements from the dashboard are re-designed to resemble popular dark themes such as Mac OS Mojave Dark mode.
Let us know what you think and what we can improve below. And good luck with development!
